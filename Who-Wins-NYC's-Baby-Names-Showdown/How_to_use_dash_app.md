Recommendation - to run the dash app locally, download the python script and the corresponding csv file in this folder and save both to the same directory.

Run the python script and in the terminal, you should see the local address where the dash app is running - http://127.0.0.1:8050/.

Type the address into the browser and you should be able to access the visualisation.

Make sure you have the Pandas / Dash / Plotly libraries in python installed.

Happy fun!
